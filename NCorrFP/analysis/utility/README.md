This directory consist of helper and auxiliary files for utlity analyis:

1. ML hyperparameter optimisation: NCorr_FP_analysis_adult_utility.ipynb
2. Best hyperparameters: {model}_best_params.json -- these are the resulting file from the notebook 1.
3. Best scores: scores.csv -- these are the best accuracy scores using the best hyperparameter settings on original Adult data (this is a baseline for utility comparison). The scores are resulting from the notebook 1.
